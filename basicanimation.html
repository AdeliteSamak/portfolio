<h3 class="podnadpis">Sprite animation on a background</h3>
<br>
<p class="text">In this assignment we were to make a frame-by-frame animation of a character we’ve made in Adobe Illustrator. We’ve how to implement a background for our moving character. I’ve chosen a Kawaii style for my astronaut puppy which is flying in the universe. Starting with sketches of character, filling out character sheet, sketching all movements and finally coding the sprite animation in html and css. You can have a look on it <a href="http://adelite.eu/corgi.html"> here</a>. </p>

<h3 class="podnadpis">JavaScript controlled animation</h3>
<br>
<p class="text">In our next project we used again our character and this time we’ve learnt basics of JavaScript by controlling our character’s actions. This helped me understand the principles of JavaScript. In this assignment we also included animated SVG. You can try his tricks <a href="http://adelite.eu/corginaut.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="podnadpis">Guess the number</h3>
<br>
<p class="text">In our next exercise we decided to create “Guess the number” game, where we improved our JavaScript skills. As advanced feature we had to implement we chose telling the user how many guesses he/she has used. The game gives user hints that either the number is too low or too high. We gave it simple minimalistic design with contrast color. You can try our guessing challenge <a href="http://adelite.eu/guessnumber.html?fbclid=IwAR2XdciGjH9KMzfzRYMMAUupfxcby5jMNj3--4TrC6FgmTUVVLSMFWnf5WM">here</a>. </p>

<h3 class="podnadpis">Onboarding</h3>
<br>
<p class="text">Next big group project was Onboarding targeting new/potential KEA students. We also wondered what a week at KEA might look like before we started our studies. And that’s why we decided to show them our week at MMD and we wanted to make series showing what a week looks like in each program. As always with every project we started with moodboard and style tile to find out the style we are looking for. We used KEA design manual due to our intention to put the onboarding on official KEA website.</p>

<br>
<p class="text">As a gamification we chose looking for hidden stickers and collecting badges. We were using Kanban chart to track our progress. We created storyboard with dramaturgical and interactive elements as well as plot, visuals, characters and this project was mainly aimed on improving our skills in JavaScript, CSS and HTML, but also on storytelling. We received a lot of positive feedback as well as objective critique. You can try our onboarding <a href="http://colorless.in/onboarding/">here</a>.</p>
