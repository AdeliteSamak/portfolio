<h3 class="podnadpis">Campaign site with video</h3>
<br>
<p class="text">Our last project of semester was to create campaign website which would spread awareness about food waste in households. We decided to produce a video showing two different approaches towards food. Weâ€™ve learnt more about video production, equipment and post production of films and videos. Next we created short video for social media focusing on spreading awareness about organization itself. On the website we chose to share interesting facts about food waste. Whole website is in similar design as the original one.</p>

<h3 class="podnadpis">Storyboard</h3>
<br>
<p class="text">Before we started filming it was necessary to make storyboard with all the details of angles, props, equipment and other requirements, to be really prepared for filming and being sure we will not miss anything in post-production. We questioned every scene so it would make sense and has got the expected effect on viewer. Audio was also very important for this project to create a correct atmosphere. </p>

<h3 class="podnadpis">Customer pitch</h3>
<br>
<p class="text">And lastly we had to do the first customer pitch which was supposed to be short, precise and contain a description of content with realistic examples and benefits. We had to answer why our project would be worth implementing or investing in. First we tried to present it to our class and next day we presented it to our customer. This gave us a great lesson of receiving and also giving feedback and being able to make adjustments to our project later on.</p>
