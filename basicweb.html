<h3 class="podnadpis">Responsive website</h3>

<p class="text">In our first greater project we’ve been assigned to produce a responsive website with relevant content. We have been given art styles, in my case it was Bauhaus. By the end of this project I’ve learnt all parts of design process while building a website from mood board, style tile, wire framing, prototyping, testing and coding. Key to great results was to know basic design principles and applying them in practice.</p>

<p class="text">I started the design process by sketching wireframes for the layout of each page of the website. Wireframes were great for planning the website and having an overview of what I needed to code. It’s very important to be consistent with the design on all screens, that’s why my website is changing just a little bit when displayed on desktop or mobile. I tried to keep it with same level of usability on both desktop and mobile versions, but later on I found out that the mobile layout can be improved.</p>

<p class="text">After sketching on paper I moved to Adobe Illustrator to create style tile which would serve as a guide for my design. First I’ve made moodboard on Bauhaus and that inspired me for overall design of website. Based on my wireframes I did a mid-fidelity prototype where I discovered more flaws of my first wireframe sketches and I tried to find a new, more user friendly solution which I’ve tested later on. I tried to improve composition by using various gestalt laws. You can try my prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/90b2924e-8827-493c-4f70-5af6b8266bcd-e683/?fullscreen&hints=off">here</a>.</p>

<p class="text">The coding was to focus on using the knowledge of CSS grids and implementing breakpoints for the main layout. It was essential to write semantically correct code for the pages to be validated.</p>
<br>
<p class="text">Website was tested with number of people online and face to face. None of them had problems with answering first three questions about what site it is, what page they are on and what are the main sections of the website. However I’ve found out that I’m missing headlines on my design article. Otherwise there were no other errors that somebody talked about.  They considered it nice to have highlighted page names which shows on which page are you on and overall nice and clean navigation bar that stick on the top of the screen as you scrolling down.</p>
