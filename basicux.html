<h3 class="podnadpis">Data collection</h3>
<br>
<p class="text">While doing my first desk research I found out that it really helps you learn more about broader context of a problem and also about similar topics. You can also learn more about recent trends and developments. We also tried to do our first observation, which helped me understand the importance of discovering and understanding customer’s behavior in order to come with perfect solution of problem. Moreover we did interviews in which we could better understand people and their experience and reasoning. Lastly we did survey in which we could collect and examine answers from larger number of people. </p>

<h3 class="podnadpis">Prototype</h3>
<br>
<p class="text">In this project I’ve gained skills in Adobe XD, which is the Adobe prototyping tool for user experience and interaction designers. Adobe XD features are used for creating wireframes, prototypes, and screen designs for digital products such as websites and mobile apps. Doing this draft version of a product allowed me to explore our ideas and show the intention behind a feature or the overall design concept to users before investing time and money into development. We produced a prototype for IN CPH by Ministry of higher Education and Science and that gave us boundaries within choosing fonts, colors and tone of voice. You can try our prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/d8d2740e-afe7-46af-5bf1-e5dd44376686-aee3/?fbclid=I-wAR0onescab9WmMso7q9Wk5rZu-SfwwT-C9yHAsd8ye1x9q58JQ2Y71LoQN0c">here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="podnadpis">Design Sprint</h3>
<br>
<p class="text">This was definitely my favorite group project of first semester. During this brisk (not even whole) week we had to make quick and wise decisions as a team and overall we’ve been given team roles which I found being highly effective in work flow. We were to create an app that would help students in their life. </p>
<br>
<img src="visuals/basicux/goal.PNG" class="articleimage" alt="goal">
<br>
<p class="text">On first day we came up with various ideas of an app and then chose the most promising one. We thought of pitfalls that might be, asked the experts and started mapping our app afterwards. We asked ourselves “How might we?” questions to see what issues we may be challenged by.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p class="text">On Tuesday we did quick sketches and chose our favorites afterwards. On Wednesday we sketch our solution sketches, to find out which way should we go with the app. Our app happened to be JoinHub, a place where you could find people attending the same events or you could choose to join or create and “hub”, which is basically a place/activity and that way you can expand your network. </p>

<br>
<p class="text">Next thing to do was story board which we created as a team on the white board. Then was time to split the roles for each member of our team. My work with my other teammate was to create a visuals of the app, which means choosing of color and font by making style tile, creating logo, icons and collect other assets. Then our other team members were able to create a prototype. </p>

<p class="text">On the final day of Design sprint we were testing our prototype with strangers and improving JoinHub. Last thing to do was pitch in class, for which we created presentation and practice our speech. Overall I review this project as the most enriching experience as a member of a team as well as being creative and time effective. You can try our prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/c9f69d8e-7452-4eba-5a46-daa0cf23a0f6-bfc7/?fbclid=IwAR1-Pgf83VicG7bh67bvtT5lDbnKNnODp2tYWkYG6-gldFSJSdWotLjLHMA">here</a>.</p>
